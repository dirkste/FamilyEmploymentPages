# Portfolio sections — ideas & backlog

Goal: complement the resume-style page with evidence of current momentum, real-world impact, and engineering judgment.

## Section: Recent activity
High signal for employers: shows you’re active and improving, not just listing history.

Ideas (pick 3–6 items initially):
- **Now**: what you’re working on this month (1–2 bullets)
- **Recently shipped**: small changelog for this site (date + one line)
- **Learning log**: focused topics + concrete output (e.g., “built X demo”, “added Y check”, “wrote Z doc”)
- **Talks / writing**: links to posts, docs, or writeups

Suggested format:
- Date
- What changed
- Why it matters (impact)

## Section: Code projects (case studies)
High signal for employers: proves skill with real artifacts and clear outcomes.

Per-project card template:
- **Problem** (context + constraints)
- **Approach** (design choices, tradeoffs)
- **Result** (metrics if possible)
- **Tech** (stack)
- **Quality** (tests, CI/CD, reliability)
- Links: repo, demo, writeup

Ideas:
- 3–6 featured projects (not a long list)
- Optional “Selected contributions” bullet list for improvements (perf, stability, DX)

## Section: Past challenges
High signal for employers: shows problem solving, leadership, and how you operate under constraints.

Challenge card template:
- **Situation**: what was broken / unclear / risky
- **Constraints**: time, tooling, access, stakeholders
- **Actions**: what you did (technical + coordination)
- **Outcome**: what improved (quality, speed, stability)
- **What I learned**: short bullet (avoid fluff)

Examples (placeholders to fill later):
- Reducing flaky automation runs and improving signal-to-noise
- Designing an automation framework + integrating it into CI/CD
- Recovering a failing test suite by fixing root causes and stabilizing patterns
- Scaling communication/process between onshore/offshore teams

## Section: Professional referrals / references
High signal when handled carefully: adds credibility without publishing sensitive info.

Privacy-safe guidance:
- Do **not** publish names, emails, phone numbers, or employer-internal details by default.
- Prefer a simple line like: **“Professional references available upon request.”**
- If you want more detail publicly, list only high-level context (no PII), e.g. “Former engineering manager (2019–2021) — can speak to test strategy + cross-team collaboration.”
- Share contact details only in private conversations (recruiter/hiring manager) or via a separate, non-indexed document.

## Other complementary sections (optional)
- **Toolbox**: keep it concise; link to evidence in projects
- **Process / how I work**: short bullets (PR hygiene, reviews, test strategy)
- **Open source / contributions**: if applicable
- **Printable resume link**: keep resume file in `public/` and link from the page

## Employer appeal checklist (what this page should answer)
- Can this candidate ship? (projects + results)
- Can they improve quality/reliability? (challenges + outcomes)
- Can they communicate and lead? (challenge writeups + examples)
- Do they have good engineering habits? (testing/CI practices)
